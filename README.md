# About-ME
My first repository to help everyone learn a little about me!
My name is Andrew.
I'm an avid gamer, but also love outdoor activies like hiking and disc golf.
I'm enrolled in the Fall 2021 cohort, and am extremely excited to start learning!
You can reach me by e-mail at aschwalm@mcc.edu or by phone/text (text preferably) at (1)989-245-4884
